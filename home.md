# Welcome to my blog

This is a tech blog that I started to share previous talks, ongoing work, and future learnings with the world. It is the start of a knowledge sharing catalogue for myself to refer back to, but also to hopefully impart some knowledge on current and future developers as they work through the field.

Keep in mind that many things in this blog may become outdated over time - however I will try to link to external references where possible. Always validate things for yourself, and use the latest information available to you.

Happy reading 📖
