Language is an essential part of human communication, and how it has developed has been a fascinating topic for linguists and psychologists for many years. It enables us to express complex thoughts and emotions, share knowledge and ideas, build social connections, and, crucially, has provided a medium on which to build the complex societies of cooperation and innovation that exist today. 

But where did it come from? And what changes could we see in the future?

While there is no definitive answer to the origin of human language, there are many complementary theories. Some suggest that language evolved from gestures, animal calls, or imitation of natural sounds. Others propose that language emerged as a result of social and cognitive pressures, such as the need for cooperation, coordination, or deception. Whatever the case may be, it is clear that language has been evolving for hundreds of thousands of years, adapting to different environments, cultures, and technologies.

One of the ways that language evolves is through dialects. Dialects are variations of a language that differ in pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, or style. They usually reflect the geographic, social, or ethnic identity of the speakers. For example, in England, there are many dialects of English, such as Cockney, Geordie, Scouse, or Yorkshire. These dialects have distinctive features that make them recognizable and unique, but speakers of each dialect are not necessarily able to understand each other, even though the overarching language is deemed to be English.

However, dialects are not static. They can change over time due to various factors, such as migration, education, media, or politics. Sometimes, dialects can converge and become more similar to each other, called dialect levelling, or sometimes are even replaced by a national standard language as the regions are formed into a single country. For instance, in Italy, many regional dialects have been replaced by one such national standard language, which is taught in schools and used in official contexts. Now, it is not uncommon for these dialects to continue to be spoken in a local context, but it shows how large scale movements can completely alter the common language across the area.

So what does this have to do with AI? 

Well, as I’m sure we’ve all seen by now, usage of large language models in the form of AI automation tools (looking at you ChatGPT) has sky rocketed in the past 6 months or so. It has become so mainstream, and the advancements so regular, that you can barely go a day without seeing or hearing someone talking about how they’re using it. What I’m sure you’ve also found, is that there is a very specific way to prompt these models to get the best results. Clearly outlining the action and associated parameters, as well as the expected result, is such an art that job listings for “Prompt Engineers” have been seen with salaries in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. It’s obvious that the better you are at forming these prompts, the better the output you’re going to get, and that building these prompts is already seen as a well desired skill.

As the world continues to become more accustomed to this manner of speaking, it feels very possible that this could flow across into our everyday language, resulting in a more concise and seemingly abrupt form of language compared to what we have today. If politeness and the language of social niceties cause confusion to the AI tools that have taken over our every day lives, then it’s easy to see how those could disappear from human-human interaction as well.

Moreover, if adoption of these tools continues to grow at the current pace, then the younger generations are going to grow alongside them and adopt the language that best helps them progress through their lives and make the best use of the tools available. There will no doubt be classes dedicated to usage of the tools in the same way we learn how to read and write today. And if everything is AI, then would there still be a need for other language classes? Would the art of building prompts supersede education in any other language?

Obviously the future of human language is unpredictable, and this post hasn’t even touched on the myriad of potential language problems that AI could cause. But it’s clear to see from a historical language evolution standpoint that there could be a tipping point on the horizon. Just as the Internet Generation have grown up through the digital age and had their education shaped by it, the AI Generation will grow up in a different world altogether, with the distinct possibility that language as a whole will see a huge shift into something virtually indistinguishable from what we know today.
